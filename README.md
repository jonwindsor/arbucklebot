# ArbuckleBot
A repository for the code behind [@ArbuckleBot](https://twitter.com/ArbuckleBot), a Twitter bot composed using [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/). Created for Creative Coding (DGST 302) at University of Mary Washington.

## Background and Function
The bot itself is inspired by the internet copypasta associated with a single comic strip panel from Jim Davis' July 13, 1986 Garfield comic strip. The original copypasta reads as follows:

> Why do they call it oven when you of in the cold food of out hot eat the food

and is paired together with Davis' comic strip panel, creating the following:

## Feats, Struggles, and Reflection
When deciding on an idea for this project, I opted to target something a step above the minimum, challenging myself by using slightly more complex syntax while also allowing for something more relaxed as I learn the methododology sorrounding Twitter bot creation. [@ArbuckleBot](https://twitter.com/ArbuckleBot) stayed rather consistant throughout its development, though small changes went a long way in increasing my happiness with the final project. The simple addition of the cropped comic strip panel to each Tweet makes the generated text look as it is itself the text bubble associated with Jon Arbuckle. While I thought of captioning the attached image with the bot-generated text would be interesting, I prefer this more subtle approach. Furthermore, a curated set of generated words makes those blurbs posted more humorous and easier to understand.
